      <p>
        In this journal I record my experiences traveling through Enlightenment
        Europe in the early eighteenth century. Each stop focuses on a key site
        or event that reveals how new ideas about science, philosophy, and
        culture reshaped the way people understood their world.

            <p>
              After a long, muddy journey, I was eager to see the renowned Royal Society when I arrived in London. People frequently talk about it as a place where bright minds get together to experiment and learn about the real world. The building didn't look very good from the outside when I arrived, but I could hear enthusiastic voices within. I felt as though I had entered an electrically charged environment when I first went in.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fragrance of old paper, ink, and warm candle wax filled the hall. Telescopes, glass jars, air pumps, magnets, and little metal weights were among the odd devices on the tables. I watched a man pump air out of a glass jar to demonstrate how a flame extinguishes without air. Two men leaned near to one other and exchanged words. They had a fight, but not a nasty one. They battled like men who were frantic to find out what was going on.
            </p>
            <p>
              On another table, I saw sketches of Jupiter's moons. Someone who has spent many hours gazing through a telescope did them really nicely. It was said by a scholar beside me, "We now follow Sir Isaac Newton's ways. We want to know what the world's rules are." As a priest discussing a sacred scripture, he talked with pride.
            </p>
            <p>
              The room was filled with a lot of noise. Someone dropped metal balls from different heights to gauge their speed. To illustrate how gravity works, another man drew lines on a whiteboard. A group in the vicinity used microscopic lenses to examine plant parts, and they were astounded by the patterns hidden inside the stems and leaves.
            </p>
            <p>
              I listened to what they had to say. They did not rely on tales or beliefs from antiquity. They made every effort. "How do we know this?" was one of the questions they asked. And then "Can we prove it?" Compared to the past, when people believed things without questioning them, this was novel and quite different.
            </p>
            <p>
              I thought it was a really wide area. Even if others didn't agree, anyone who wanted to learn might speak up. I saw tiny children standing near to elderly men wearing white wigs. Together, they were studying. Their discussions were honest and full of hope that learning may help people comprehend the world rather than fear it.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I walked out of the Royal Society, the sky over London appeared the same, but I felt different. I could see how people's thoughts were being impacted by this place and the work being done there. The old world was coming to an end. In a culture that prized reason, investigation, and evidence, a new one was beginning.

            <p>
              When I arrived in Paris, the city was bustling and noisy, with horses, carts, and people yelling in the streets. I had heard that authors, thinkers, and dreamers congregated at Café Procope, so I asked a few guys how to get there. They smiled and led me along a narrow street lined with little shops and bright lights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Café Procope was easy to locate. The windows let in nice light, and I could hear conversations outside. When I came in, the air was filled with the aroma of delicious pastries and coffee. Although there were many people in the room, it wasn't overly crowded. At marble tables, people sat closely together, working on paper or engaged in discussion.
            </p>
            <p>
              I sat next to these men who were chatting a lot. "Everyone should be able to think for themselves," stated one with a strong voice and keen eyes. Another man, calmer but no less powerful, stressed that reason, not antiquated traditions that no longer made sense, should govern everything. Their words were straightforward yet powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next to me, a young man whispered, "That's Voltaire." He frequently visits here. I silently observed, amazed that a famous thinker was in the same room as me, conversing as if he were a regular customer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Across the room, I saw another man displaying pages from a large book that was filled with illustrations and explanations. He was creating the Encyclopédie, a massive book that was meant to compile all of human knowledge, according to someone. I heard them discuss the value of education and the need to replace superstition with reason and observation. Like sparks leaping from one place to another, their conversations moved quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The café was bustling, with chairs scuffing the wooden floor, spoons clinking against cups, and customers pushing forward as the disputes grew louder. There were debates about art, science, the government, and justice, among other topics. I even heard someone say that if a monarch doesn't care about the people, they shouldn't be in power. That notion caused a few heads to turn.
            </p>
            <p>
              I saw that this café was more than simply a coffee shop as I looked around. It was a gathering ground for ideas that may change entire nations. Here, people felt free to express their opinions. Nobody was scared to express their opinions. Since they wished to improve the world, they discussed them openly.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I left Café Procope, the night was cold, but my mind was warm. Not because of the tables and chairs, but because of the daring conversations taking place here, I understood how important this place was. Here, people were generating fresh ideas that would eventually extend much beyond the confines of that tiny café in Paris.

          <div class="site-body">
            <p>
              A few days after I visited Café Procope, Madame Geoffrin sent me an invitation to a salon that I had only heard about. Her home was regarded as one of the most important places in Paris, not because it was large or wealthy, but rather because so many intelligent people called it home. I was nervous as I made my way through the congested streets, wondering if I belonged there.
            </p>
            <p>
              A servant allowed me in after opening the door when I arrived at her home. While calming music played somewhere deeper in the house, the corridor smelled of fresh bread and perfume. I followed the sounds until I arrived at a large, well-lit room with many people seated in a circle around chairs. The walls were painted, and there were lights everywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the center was Madame Geoffrin herself. She was quiet and firm, so even though she wasn't ostentatious or loud, everyone paid attention when she spoke. She gave me a kind greeting before returning to her role as the night's argument leader. It was remarkable to see how effortlessly a woman led a group of well-known thinkers and artists.
            </p>
            <p>
              The topic of discussion that evening was education and how people learn. One individual suggested that rather than merely memorizing historical regulations, children should be taught to think independently. Another individual made the case that everyone, not just those with money, should be able to pursue education. A painter discussed how art was becoming more about real emotions and human stories as a result of new ideas about rationality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even when people disagreed, they were all polite, which surprised me the most. The voices remained steady as everyone waited their turn to speak. As servers quietly made their way around the room delivering warm drinks and little pastries, I could hear the clinking of teacups.
            </p>
            <p>
              A young woman once read a poem she had written about the value of truth and freedom. Even though her hands shook slightly, the room remained still and listened to what she said. When she was finished, everyone in the group praised her courage. I was struck by how peculiar this was. Although women were still not allowed to express their thoughts freely in many places, they were valued and embraced here.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the majority of the night, I sat quietly, listening and taking it all in. Politics, art, science, and even daily life were discussed. However, every subject seemed to return to the same notion: that if people used reason and shared what they understood, society may be nicer, wiser, and better.
            </p>
            <p>
              Madame Geoffrin thanked everyone for coming and escorted them to the door at the end of the evening. As I stepped outside into the cold Paris night, I got the impression that I had witnessed something unique and important. A salon was more than just a place to gather; it was a place where new ideas were born, ideas that may one day change the world.

            <p>
              I heard that the University of Göttingen was gaining greater recognition when I traveled east to the German states. According to experts, it's one of the best places to study, particularly science. When I arrived on a chilly morning, the city seemed calm and well-organized. With books in their arms, students sprinted across the university's grounds, chatting excitedly as they went.
            </p>
            <p>
              A good-hearted young student offered to take me the way to the observatory when I asked for instructions. Situated on a tiny hill, the building had tall windows on the sides and a spherical dome on top. Although it wasn't ostentatious, it exuded a sense of seriousness, as if it were a place where people worked carefully. I heard faint whispers and soft footsteps coming from within as we drew nearer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was led by the student to a room with several persons gathered around a large telescope. While one man scrawled notes on a long sheet of paper, the other moved it gently and slowly. On the wall behind them was a star chart with several tiny dots joined by thin lines. The smell of old books, ink, and telescope grease filled the air.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was greeted by a gray-haired professor. He informed me of their actions and spoke politely to me. He said, "We look at the sky to learn about the laws of nature. We adhere to Newton's theories. He demonstrated how apples and planets are moved by the same force." He spoke in a calm yet attentive tone.
            </p>
            <p>
              I should look through the telescope, he said. I pressed my eye against the cool metal and saw a brilliant point of light, more brilliant than anything I had ever seen. It was a star, he said, whose position they measured each night. He said, "If we pay attention, we can learn how the heavens move."
            </p>
            <p>
              As the academics worked, I observed them. One individual glanced at a very precise clock. Another person examined the star's location and contrasted it with the lines on a sheet. They corrected each other's mistakes and exchanged ideas in a quiet conversation. Instead of claiming to know everything, they collaborated to test and verify.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, he showed me their tools, which included small lenses, rulers, note-filled binders, and intricate drawings of the moon's surface. "Science is not magic or secret knowledge," he said. It was founded on reason and observation and took a long time.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I stepped out of the observatory, the sky was becoming orange. I was in awe as I looked up. Although I had always known that the universe was above me, I had never before understood it in this way. Each night brought these researchers one step closer to their goal of reading the sky like a book.
            </p>
            <p>
              I realized that locations like these were creating a new universe as I made my way back through Göttingen's serene streets. In this universe, knowledge was derived from in-depth research and idea exchange rather than from long-held, unquestioned assumptions.

              There was music everywhere in Vienna, where my trip came to an end. Although everyone was proud of their composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was the name that shone out. I used the rest of my travel money to get a ticket to see his new opera, <em>The Magic Flute</em>, which was being produced. I was curious as to why his music was so well-liked.
            </p>
            <p>
              The opera theater was bustling and colorful when I arrived. Well-dressed men and women stepped out of carriages parked on the street and spoke animatedly. The air smelled pleasant from the warm wax from the lanterns and the aromatic perfume of the throng. When I entered the hall, I felt small. The walls were adorned with gold embellishments, and the ceiling was rather high. Everyone was seated and waiting for the show to begin.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the musicians prepared, the calming sound of tuning permeated the room. Drums were being checked, flutes were warming up, and strings were buzzing. The music began when the lights went out. Everything was lighthearted and enjoyable at first, and I couldn't help but smile.
            </p>
            <p>
              The story of <em>The Magic Flute</em> was fascinating. It was about a princess who was trapped, a prince who was seeking the truth, and an educated group of men who were seeking virtue and wisdom. The costumes the characters wore were bright and colorful. There were serious and hilarious passages. However, they all gave you optimism and the impression that you were learning something. It didn't take me long to realize that the opera wasn't only for entertainment. It was filled with the same values I had witnessed at the observatory, the cafés, the salons, and the Royal Society: moral strength, intelligence, and reason.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the performance, the audience clapped, gasped, and laughed. As they responded to each moment, I saw their faces shine in the candlelight. When the Queen of the Night sang her famous high notes, everyone in the room held their breath and stopped talking. She had a strong, passionate voice. As Sarastro spoke of knowledge and fraternity, the music became steady and serene. It resembled a calm prayer for a more favorable world.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was profoundly affected by the opera's music and story, which blended light and dark. According to Mozart, there are both hope and fear in life, but people may use reason to overcome confusion.
            </p>
            <p>
              The audience stood up and gave a loud cheer when the final scene concluded. I joined them in clapping till my hands ached. I could still hear the songs in my head as I stepped outdoors into the cold Vienna night. Since the opera demonstrated how Enlightenment ideas even altered music and art, it was the ideal way for me to wrap out my vacation.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I made my way back to my small room, I felt grateful. I had seen firsthand how this century was changing in terms of ideas, science, culture, and even music. And I realized that the future will be impacted by these developments.
